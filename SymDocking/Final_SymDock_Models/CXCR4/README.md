The mutant CXCR4 structural models are named after the mutations in canonical protein residue number. 
The mutation in structural models have different residue number due to unmodelled unstructural loops on N-terminal.

Protein sequence number:              N192W, L194R, L194K, W195L 
Residue number in structural models:  N166W, L168R, L168K, W169L
